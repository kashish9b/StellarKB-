# Crypto Lottery DApp

## Project Title
Crypto Lottery DApp - A decentralized blockchain-based lottery system built on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform.

## Project Description
Crypto Lottery DApp is a transparent and fair lottery system that leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless environment for lottery participants. Built on Stellar's Soroban platform, this dApp allows users to purchase lottery tickets using cryptocurrency, with all transactions, ticket purchases, and winner selections executed through smart contracts.

The lottery operates in rounds, with each round having a set ticket price. Users purchase tickets, and once the draw occurs, the smart contract randomly selects a winner who receives the entire pot. The transparent nature of blockchain technology ensures that all operations are visible and verifiable by participants, eliminating concerns about fairness that plague traditional lottery systems.

This project demonstrates the power of decentralized applications in creating fair and transparent systems for activities that traditionally require trusted third parties.

## Project Vision
The vision for Crypto Lottery DApp is to revolutionize traditional lottery systems by removing centralized control and introducing absolute transparency and fairness. We aim to:

1. Create a truly decentralized lottery system with no central authority that can manipulate outcomes
2. Provide immediate payouts to winners without delays or administrative overhead
3. Offer lower fees compared to traditional lotteries, allowing more value to flow to participants
4. Build a global lottery system accessible to anyone with internet access and cryptocurrency
5. Demonstrate practical applications of blockchain technology beyond financial transactions
6. Educate users about blockchain technology through an engaging and familiar use case

By achieving these goals, Crypto Lottery DApp will serve as a showcase for how blockchain technology can transform established systems by introducing transparency, efficiency, and global accessibility.
